Welcome to the repository for the official version of GreenPurpleGrid.com!

I'm not planning to make any money off of this game, so I figured I'd make it open source so that I can more easily use it as a portfolio piece. That said, only I can contribute to the official version of the game directly. If you have your own ideas about how this game could work, you can make a fork of the repo and do whatever you want with that fork.
